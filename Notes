Trying to make the search bar wider,
I tried applying to the classes, search, search-bar and input also input[type=text, I also tried to make a special class inside the <input>.
Then I made an id inside the <input>

was applying width: xx%; or px

nothing works.
maybe there is something applied to the parent element
that causes this fuckery?

tried to make another form, outside of the divs, nothing works here either.

tried adding a class, then an id, to both the new form and the old. did not work.

I think perhaps the problem lies in the declaration, not selector.


the internet says it should be as simple as

 input {
  width: 100%;
}

finally fixed it, with 

#desperation {
    display: flex;
    width: 200%;
    position: relative;
    right: 50%;
}

Now I am trying to seperate the two buttons below the search bar
Tried giving them seperate class, even id's and give them their own margins
why does it treat it like one element?
because they are the parents of the <div class="search-buttons">
I am guessing.

try disabling all css rules applied to that class, and see
if you can work them as 2 elements of one class.


seems to work strangely though.

Now I will attempt to fix the footer.
