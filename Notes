Trying to make the search bar wider,
I tried applying to the classes, search, search-bar and input also input[type=text, I also tried to make a special class inside the <input>.
Then I made an id inside the <input>

was applying width: xx%;

nothing works.
maybe there is something applied to the parent element
that causes this fuckery?

tried to make another form, outside of the divs, nothing works here either.

tried adding a class, then an id, to both the new form and the old. did not work.

I think perhaps the problem lies in the declaration, not selector.
